OK, so, the problem is on dark mode OSX Yosemite (10.10), the Synapase do got at dark theme, so i made a shell script to solde that problem. At the Terminal.app:

{% highlight Bash %}
chmod 777 razer.sh
./razer.sh black (for dark mode icon)

./razer.sh white (for white mode icon – icons back to normal)
{% endhighlight %}
