As at the beginning of the Google Drive at OSX dark mode, the Google Photos Backup do not adept itâ€™s menu bar icon to Dark Mode, even worst, at Photos, it even came the dark mode icons at download.

So, i made a little script to solve this problem.

To run it, make it could change files, so:

{% highlight Bash %}
# chmod 777 fix_google_photos.sh
than: (to change to dark mode icons)

# /fix_google_photos.sh black
or: (to change to white mode icons)

# /fix_google_photos.sh white
{% endhighlight %}
